    This object animator is used as a custom fragment transition. See
    FragmentTransaction.setCustomAnimation for more details.

    The overall effect of this animator is to rotate the front of the card
    out of view. The order of operations is described below:

    1. The front rotates 90 degrees, from facing the user to being
       zero-width, fully perpendicular to the viewer, facing left.
    2. The front is then made invisible (this is half-way through the
       animation).
    3. The front rotates another 90 degrees, from zero-width, to
       100% of its normal width, but facing away from the user and
       still invisible.

    This is accomplished using the 2 child animators below, executed in
    parallel. Note that the last animator starts half-way into the animation.
