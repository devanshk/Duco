Duco is Tinder for artwork, created at the Carnegie Museum of Art's 120th Anniversary.

##What it is
The user swipes left or right based on a snap judgement on whether they like a piece of art. We take in a json with the museum's art data and populate our own system with it. As the user keeps swiping, our algorithm determines their preferences.

Here's an example of a user who is an architecture-buff using the app.

You'll notice the artwork focuses towards buildings as they keep swiping right.
