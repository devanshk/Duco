Duco is Tinder for artwork, created at the Carnegie Museum of Art's 120th Anniversary.

##What it is
The user swipes left or right based on a snap judgement on whether they like a piece of art. We populate the list of art pieces with a json containing useful info and an image url for each of 30,000 items of art.
